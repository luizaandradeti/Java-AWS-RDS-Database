#### 6.1 Troubleshooting 
When creating a new account, the permissions are for the root user, as this is the account of the person or company that created it.
It is important to have accounts, users and roles with granular permission.

If you have a corporate user on a company-granted account who doesn't have access (login) yet, or has lost it, and is asked to perform a task that requires that access, you can recover that information by requesting it from the authorized technology administrator (usually through an internal ticket, such as Service Now), who will retrieve it through AWS IAM. You will need to consult with your lead (who will show you the way to get this login recovery done within the timeframe stipulated by the SLA). Some companies purchase plans that include more support and AWS consultants to assist their development team. 

For a personal account with first-time users, it is useful to have official plans that meet this need.

> Obviously, having an official consultant for the cloud you have purchased reduces many problems.

In case of lack of access, in non-root users, in personal accounts for study, it is necessary to assign this access to the user in the profile, in the user's assignments, from the user who has the scope with specific permission (allow) for this (assign actions).

##### 6.1.2 If No access AWS RDS (enterprise account)

> [!NOTE]
> 
> I recommend consulting the official documentation

If you have a corporate user from a company-granted account, and you do not yet have access (RDS), or have lost access to RDS, and are asked to perform a task that requires this access, you can easily retrieve this information by requesting it from the authorized technology administrator (usually via an internal ticket, e.g. Service Now), who will retrieve it through AWS IAM. You need to enable this specific permission (allow) if it is a task assigned directly to you.

You need to ask your leader, who will add this permission through AWS IAM or show you how to do it. The timeframe and method vary depending on the ticket model adopted, and it is crucial to follow good documentation practices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the account is personal for studies, without any connection to the company, the permission is configured in the user management panel.
> In general, all cloud resources, requires permission per user (the more granular the privilege, the more secure the environment), which can be done through the user management panel, according to the company's needs, in accordance with good practices:
